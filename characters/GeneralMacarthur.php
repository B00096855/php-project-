<h1>General Macarthur</h1>

<h3> Bio </h3>
<p>
    The general is an interesting character, for the most part of the play
    he sits on his own mumbling about cryptic things.
    The general over the course of the play is shown as a slow and lonely
    old man but the truth is much different. He instead is a man that is tired of
    keeping the secret that he sent his wifes lover to his death during the war.

    With the guilt of everything he drives away his friends and family leading to
    isloation, only after his wife dies did the lonelyness really set in.
    "Funny, just this minute he didn't want much to get away from the island...
    To go back to the mainland, back to his little house, back to all the troubles
    and worries." This is clear that he didnt want to go back to his old live and
    all that came with it.
