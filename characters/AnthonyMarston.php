<h1>Anthony Marston</h1>

<h3> Bio </h3>
<p>
    Anthony Marston is the first character to die, but the time we spend with him
    is enough to show is full personality. While Anthony is described as young,
    rich and hansom he is also egotisical, arragent and acts like a spoiled
    child most of the time.

    The reason Anthony is there is due to the car accedident he got into several
    years ago. He ran over two children with what seems to be no remorce and
    not a care for the consequences.
