        The classic "And then there were none" was writen by Agatha Christie in 1939.
        It follows the story of seven seemingly random people that have been called to an
        island off the coast of Devon, England.
        <br>
        On the island is a mansion tended by two newly hired servants, nether of which have seen
        the owner of the house. With all the guests there and still no sign of the owner the
        gramophone put on by one of the servants, the contents on the gramophone reveal
        that everyone that is in the house has commited a crime resulting in someones death.
        <br>
        Signed by "U.N. Owen" the mystery man who organised all of it death quickly follows the
        ending of the message from the gramophone as one of the members drops dead from posion in
        his drink.
        <br>
        The rest of the play revolves around suspicion between one another, and the forced trust
        between small groups. One by one each member is killed off, until there were none.
